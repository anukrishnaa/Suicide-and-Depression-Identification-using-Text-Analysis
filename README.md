Suicide and Depression Identification using Text Analysis


The project aims to create a reliable tool for early detection of mental health issues based on social media data.
This project, Suicide and Depression Identification using Text Analysis, leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques to detect signs of mental health struggles in Reddit posts from subreddits like r/depression and r/SuicideWatch.  The dataset consists of posts from mental health-related subreddits (e.g., r/depression, r/SuicideWatch). The objective is to classify these posts as related to mental health issues, such as depression or suicidal ideation. Four models are employed for classification: Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision Tree Classifier, Logistic Regression, and Random Forest Classifier. These models are evaluated using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, with Random Forest and SVM yielding the best results for identifying suicidal ideation and depression.
