Suicide and Depression Identification using Text Analysis


This project aims to identify signs of suicide and depression in text data using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning classifiers. The dataset consists of posts from mental health-related subreddits (e.g., r/depression, r/SuicideWatch). The objective is to classify these posts into categories related to mental health issues, such as depression or suicidal ideation.
