Suicide and Depression Identification using Text Analysis

Project Overview
This project aims to identify signs of suicide and depression in text data using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning classifiers. The dataset consists of posts from mental health-related subreddits (e.g., r/depression, r/SuicideWatch). The objective is to classify these posts into categories related to mental health issues, such as depression or suicidal ideation.

Features
Dataset: Text data from Reddit posts on mental health, including r/depression and r/SuicideWatch.
Text Preprocessing: Tokenization, stop-word removal, and TF-IDF vectorization.
Machine Learning Models: Implemented multiple models to classify the text data:
Support Vector Machine (SVM)
Decision Tree Classifier
Logistic Regression
Random Forest Classifier
Performance Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score
